abstract = {The problem of maximizing the profit achieved by hiring servers from a Cloud and offering virtual machines to paying customers is examined. A number of VMs, each running a user job, can share a server. Hiring a server incurs an initial set-up cost, as well as running costs proportional to the duration of hire. New jobs that cannot start immediately may be lost, or they may be queued. It may or may not be possible to move running VMs from server to server. The effect of these different conditions on several hiring policies, both static and dynamic, is analyzed and evaluated.},

@inproceedings{Wen2014b,
abstract = {The significant increase in the use of cloud computing, has led to an interest in partitioning applications over a set of public and private clouds in order to meet a range of non-functional requirements including performance (for example where private cloud resources alone are insufficient), dependability (e.g. To allow the application to continue to operate even if one cloud fails) and security (for example to ensure that sensitive data is restricted to sufficiently secure clouds and networks). This paper describes a novel deployment planning algorithm to partition complex workflow-based applications over federated clouds, while meeting security requirements. The security issues are based on our previous work which extends the Bell-La Padula model to encompass cloud computing. Selecting the cheapest option for partitioning a workflow over a set of resources has been shown to be an NP-hard problem, which can take impractically long for partitioning large workflows over multiple clouds. We therefore introduce a novel adaptive partitioning algorithm to handle these large workflow applications, which significantly reduces the time required to choose a sufficiently good partitioning option. This is based on generating an initial partitioning, and then adapting it to see if a better solution can be found by bringing together on the same node services with significant communication costs. The algorithm has been implemented and evaluated by using both randomly generated and real world scientific workflows. The experiment results show that our algorithm is thousand times quicker than the exhaustive algorithm presented in our previous work. Yet, on average it generates only 25{\%} more costly solutions. We also compared this algorithm with two other methods commonly used to partition workflows over a set of clouds.},

@article{Hiden2013,
abstract = {This paper describes the e-Science Central (e-SC) cloud data processing system and its application to a number of e-Science projects. e-SC provides both software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service for scientific data management, analysis and collaboration. It is a portable system and can be deployed on both private (e.g. Eucalyptus) and public clouds (Amazon AWS and Microsoft Windows Azure). The SaaS application allows scientists to upload data, edit and run workflows and share results in the cloud, using only a Web browser. It is underpinned by a scalable cloud platform consisting of a set of components designed to support the needs of scientists. The platform is exposed to developers so that they can easily upload their own analysis services into the system and make these available to other users. A representational state transfer-based application programming interface (API) is also provided so that external applications can leverage the platform's functionality, making it easier to build scalable, secure cloud-based applications. This paper describes the design of e-SC, its API and its use in three different case studies: spectral data visualization, medical data capture and analysis, and chemical property prediction.},

@article{Cala2013,
abstract = {Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) is a method for creating models that can predict certain properties of compounds. It is of growing importance in the design of new drugs. The quantity of data now available for building models is increasing rapidly, which has the advantage that more accurate models can be created, for a wider range of properties. However the disadvantage is that the amount of computation required for model building has also dramatically increased. Therefore, it became vital to find a way to accelerate this process. We have achieved this by exploiting parallelism in searching the QSAR model space for the best models. This paper shows how the cloud computing paradigm can be a good fit to this approach. It describes the design and implementation of a tool for exploring the model space that exploits our e-Science Central cloud platform. We report on the scalability achieved and the experiences gained when designing the solution. The acceleration and absolute performance achieved is much greater than for existing QSAR solutions, creating the potential for new, interesting research, and the exploitation of this approach to accelerate other types of applications.},

Adaptation, as an essential concept of contemporary distributed systems, is used to improve planning of component deployment. There is described a concept and implementation of mechanisms which, using monitoring infrastructure and simple policy-based engine, allows improving execution efficiency. The presented tool, named CCMAD, is intended for use with OpenCCM platform, an open source Java implementation of CCM model. It is, however, expected that adapting CCMAD for any other CCM platform would not be troublesome.},
